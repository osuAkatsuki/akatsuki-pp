# Akatsuki PP System

This is Akatsuki's pp system, a modified version of oppai-ng with relax in mind.

## Usage

To build oppai for cmd line usage, use `./build`.

To build oppai as a library, use `./libbuild`

More documentation is available on the original oppai repo.

## Contributing

Note we are not looking for miniscule changes to the pp system, if any at all. If you want to contribute that is fine however it should be well thought out, explained and be of use.
